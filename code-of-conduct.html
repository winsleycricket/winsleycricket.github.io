    <h1><font color="#00af50"><li>The spirit of Winsley</h1></li></font>
    <p>Members of Winsley are united by a shared enthusiasm and love of cricket
    and its wish to pursue this interest within a Club where all are welcome
    and encouraged whatever their previous experience of the sport. Winsley’s
    strength lies in the breadth of the age and background of its membership
    and its commitment to ensure that regardless of ability everyone enjoys the
    game. There is a duty of the more experienced to encourage and help build
    up the self-esteem of the less confident; anything less, on or off the field of
    play, is divisive and destructive of the ethos of the Club.
    Winsley strives to be an environment where everyone can be themselves
    and any form of discrimination, misogyny or bullying will not be tolerated.
    Therefore, it is essential that:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>No player should attempt to usurp or undermine the authority of the
    Captain.</li>
    <li>Players should recognise that field placements are the prerogative of
    the Captain in liaison with the Bowler and, if he/she chooses, after
    consulting with the Vice-Captain(s).</li>
    <li>Players and supporters should recognise that praise and encourage
    ment are far more effective in building confidence and improving per
    formance than harsh criticism and ridicule.</li>
    <li>Members should consider how their words (whether face to face or
    indirectly, or electronically communicated in club WhatsApp groups
    or other public forums) or actions may be received by any others, who
    may hear or see the comments. This shall apply regardless of their
    intentions or perceptions.</li>
    <li>No member should openly and loudly direct abuse or criticism at a
    player who has made an error or convey their displeasure in a manner
    intended to be seen and/or heard.</li>
    <li>Players should never, in response to their own mistakes, seek ‘scape
    goats’ by placing the blame on another player or an umpire.</li>
    <li> Players and supporters should demonstrate a high level of sportsmanship at all times even in the face of intimidation.</li>
    <li> No player or supporter should endanger the reputation of the Club by
    the excessive consumption of alcohol or use of illicit drugs before or
    during a game or a post-match social.</li>
    <li> No member shall ‘vape’ inside the clubhouse or on the field of play
    (irrespective of the type of fixture)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By signing up as a member of Winsley CC or by taking part in any
    event the club offers, it is our expectation that people uphold the spirit of
    the club.</p>

    <h1><font color="#00af50"><li>Playing values</h1></li></font>
    <p>Winsley Cricket Club hold three simple values which should be present and
    seen in everything that we do on and off the field. They are:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Humility</li>
    <li>Hard work</li>
    <li>Putting the team /club above self interest</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>We encourage all members to demonstrate these values in any club activity. We also believe in encouraging our players that the simple things
    go a long way towards creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for
    everyone to enjoy cricket, our club and its surroundings. For this to happen
    we encourage the following values:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Punctuality</li>
    <li>Effort</li>
    <li>Positive attitude, energy and
    body language</li>
    <li>Passion</li>
    <li>Being coachable</li>
    <li>Doing extra</li>
    <li>Being prepared</li>
    <li>Being polite</li>
    <li>Being helpful to get the game on</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We believe these principles, which are not grounded in success and results
    will create an environment where good people share good experiences and
    values. That in turn will lead to the success and development which we
    believe everyone wants for Winsley CC. The values are deliberately grounded
    in the way we conduct ourselves, as we firmly believe doing the ‘right thing’
    pays off and brings its own rewards. By signing up as a playing member
    of Winsley CC or by taking part in any event the club offers, it is our
    expectation that people uphold these personal standards.</p>

    <h1><font color="#00af50"><li>Equality</h1></li></font>
    <p>The club is committed to ensuring that equality is incorporated across all
    aspects of its development. Sports equality is about fairness in sport, equal
    ity of access, recognising inequalities and taking steps to address them. It
    is about changing the culture and structure of sport to ensure it becomes
    accessible for everyone.</p>

    <p>The club respects the rights, dignity and worth of every person and will
    treat everyone equally within the context of our sport, regardless of age,
    gender, disability, race, ethnic origin, religion, nationality, colour, social status, political beliefs, marital status, pregnancy status, gender reassignment
    and sexual orientation.</p>

    <p>The club is committed to everyone having the right to enjoy cricket in
    an environment free from threat of intimidation, harassment and abuse.</p>

    <p><b>All club members have a responsibility to oppose discriminatory behaviour.</b></p>
    
    <p>The club will deal with any incidence of discriminatory behaviour seriously and in accordance with club disciplinary procedures in this policy.
    Any breach of the Code may lead to being warned of his/her future conduct
    or in serious cases being suspended or barred from participation in club
    activities.</p>

    <h2><font color="#00af50">5.2 Spirit of Cricket [Preamble to the Laws of Cricket (2017
Code 2nd Edition 2019, MCC)]</h2></font>
    
    <p><i>‘Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be
    played not only according to the Laws, but also within the Spirit of Cricket.
    The major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but
    extends to all players, match officials and, especially in junior cricket, teach
    ers, coaches and parents. Respect is central to the Spirit of Cricket. Respect
    your captain, team-mates, opponents and the authority of the umpires. Play
    hard and play fair. Accept the umpire’s decision. Create a positive atmo
    sphere by your own conduct and encourage others to do likewise. Show self
    discipline, even when things go against you. Congratulate the opposition on
    their successes and enjoy those of your own team. Thank the officials and
    your opposition at the end of the match, whatever the result. Cricket is an
    exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship and teamwork, which
    brings together people from different nationalities, cultures and religions,
    especially when played within the Spirit of Cricket.’
    </i></p>

    
    <h2><font color="#00af50">5.3 Spirit of Cricket ECB Guidance</h2></font>
    <p>There are two Laws which place the responsibility for the team’s conduct
    firmly on the captain:</p>

    <p><b>Responsibility of Captains</b></p>
    <p>The captains are responsible at all times for ensuring that play is conducted
    within the Spirit of the Game as well as within the Laws.</p>

    <p><b>Player’s Conduct</b></p>
    <p>In the event of any player failing to comply with the instructions of an
    umpire, criticising his/her decision by word or action, showing dissent, or
    generally behaving in a manner which might bring the game into disrepute,
    the umpire concerned shall in the first place report the matter to the other
    umpire and to the player’s captain, requesting the latter to take action.</p>

    <p><b>Fair and Unfair Play</b></p>
    <p>According to the Laws the umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play.
    The umpires may intervene at any time, applying Law 42 (Players Conduct)
    when deemed appropriate, and it is the responsibility of the captain to take
    action where required.
    The umpires are authorised to intervene in cases of:</p>

    <ul>
    <li> Time wasting</li>
    <li> Damaging the pitch</li>
    <li> Dangerous or unfair bowling</li>
    <li> Tampering with the ball</li>
    <li> Any other action that they consider to be unfair</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Spirit of the Game involves RESPECT for:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Your opponents</li>
    <li> Our own captain and team</li>
    <li> The role of the umpires</li>
    <li> The game’s traditional values</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is against the Spirit of the Game:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> To dispute an umpire’s decision by word, action or gesture</li>
    <li> To direct abusive language towards an opponent or umpire</li>
    <li> Toindulge in cheating or any sharp practice, for instance, appeal know
    ing the batsman is not out, advance towards an umpire in an aggressive
    manner when appealing, seek to distract an opponent either verbally
    or by harassment with persistent clapping or unnecessary noise under
    the guise of enthusiasm and motivation of one’s own side.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Violence</b></p>

    <p>There is no place for any act of violence on the field of play.</p>

    <p><b>Players</b></p>
    Captains and umpires together set the tone for the conduct of a cricket
    match. Every player is expected to make an important contribution to this.

    <h2><font color="#00af50">5.4 Parent and Guardian code of conduct</h2></font>
    <p>As part of our environment and values we ask Parents to buy into our
    culture, spirit, values and behaviours. Winsley Cricket Club expect:</p>

    <ul>
    <li> Remember that young people participate for pleasure- winning is only
    part of the fun. Help your child recognise enjoyment, not just results.</li>
    <li> Set a good example by recognising fair play and applauding the good
    performance of all. Encourage your child to learn the rules and play
    within them</li>

    <li> Never punish or belittle a child for losing or making mistakes.</li>
    <li> Accept officials’ judgments and do not argue with officials, team managers, captains and coaches. These officials will be behaving in a way
    which upholds our values and behaviours. If they are not, the pro
    cesses of this document will handle that. We expect parents to discuss
    such matters with the correct officials calmly and escalate them ap
    propriately within this policy</li>
    <li> When attending coaching sessions or matches, learn to distinguish
    between encouragement and instruction.</li>
    <li> Do not encroach onto training or playing areas.</li>
    <li> Support your child’s involvement with encouragement, but do not give
    instructions to players, either verbal or non-verbal, once they are tak
    ing part in a coaching session or match.</li>
    <li> Do not make disparaging remarks about players or officials.</li>
    <li> Never force your child to take part in cricket.</li>
    <li> Display control and respect towards all involved in cricket. This in
    cludes opponents, coaches, umpires, administrators, other parents and
    spectators.</li>
    <li> Encourage your child to do the same.</li>
    <li> Respect the rights, dignity and worth of every person regardless of
    their characteristics, protected or otherwise</li>


    </ul>

    <h2><font color="#00af50">5.5 Captains and coaches code of conduct</h2></font>

        <ul>
    <li> Remember that young people participate for pleasure– winning is only
    part of the fun.</li>
    <li> Never ridicule or yell at a player for making a mistake or not coming
    first.</li>
    <li> Make sure all activities are planned appropriate to the age, ability and
    experience of those taking part, whilst also ensuring that equipment
    and facilities meet safety standards.</li>
    <li> Operate within the rules and spirit of cricket and teach your players
    to do the same.</li>
    <li> Display consistently high standards of behaviour, appearance and time
    keeping, remembering that coaches also act as role models for young
    people. For example, wear the appropriate club coaching attire, come
    on time and do not smoke in front of children.</li>

    <li> Hold the appropriate and valid qualifications. Keep up to date with
    the latest cricket coaching practices and principles of growth and de
    velopment of young people.</li>
    <li> Display control and respect towards all involved in cricket. This in
    cludes opponents, coaches, umpires, administrators, parents and spec
    tators.</li>
    <li> Encourage your players to do the same.</li>
    <li> Avoid overplaying the more talented players; all young players need
    and deserve equal time, attention and opportunities.</li>
    <li> Be reasonable in your demands on players’ time, energy and enthusiasm, ensuring that the time they spend with you is a positive experience.</li>
    <li> Any physical contact with a young person should be appropriate to
    the situation and necessary for the player’s skill development. Respect the rights, dignity and worth of every person regardless of their
    characteristics, protected or otherwise.</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h1><font color="#00af50"><li>Reporting and Resolving Breaches of this Code of Conduct</h1></li></font>
    <p>Nothing in this Code of Conduct alters the onus on the captains to ensure
    the spirit of fair play is followed by his/her team. Any breach of the Code of
    Conduct may be brought to the attention (whether verbally or in writing) of
    the club by any person, and will be heard, in the first instance by the Cricket
    Committee, chaired by the Club Captain as the chair of that committee.
    That hearing makes recommendations to the Executive Committee. The
    Executive Committee will be the final arbiters of any sanction imposed.
    A player, member of official shall be entitled to appeal against a finding of
    guilt and / or penalty imposed in respect of any Level Offence, in writing
    to the club secretary within 14 days of notification.</p>

    <p>The secretary will convene a hearing within 21 days from receipt of the
    appeal notice, following the appeals process. Any appeal shall be held by the
    Executive Committee Chairperson who will hold the final decision. This
    is because the Executive Committee as a whole signed off on the original
    recommendation of the Cricket Committee. In the event of an appeal, player,
    member of official shall be entitled to present their views to the appeal
    hearing, with the chair of the original hearing presenting the facts of the
    process.</p>

    <p>No outcome of any hearing will ever be pre-determined and pre-set. It
    should be understood that level 1 offences are more likely to result in a
    reprimand. Level 2 and 3 more likely to result in a ban from cricket and
    club activities and Level 4 is likely to result in expulsion from the club.
    Winsley CC understand each circumstance is unique and different and will
    consider the full facts in any scenario, documenting our decisions and the
    facts accordingly. This is why we don’t predefine the outcome of any process.
    Where a breach of the club’s code of conduct relates to a member of the
    Executive Committee, the matter will be discussed by 3 members of the
    Executive Committee to resolve. In some cases it will be necessary to
    involve and report the matter to Wiltshire Cricket and/or the ECB.</p>

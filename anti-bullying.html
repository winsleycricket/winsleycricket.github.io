<h2><font color="#00af50">Anti bullying policy</font></h2>

<h2><font color="#00af50">Statement of intent</font></h2>

<p>We are committed to providing a caring, friendly and safe environment for all of our children so they can train, and play, in a relaxed and secure atmosphere. 
    Bullying of any kind is unacceptable at our club. 
    If bullying does occur, all children should be able to tell, and know, incidents will be dealt with promptly and effectively. 
We are a TELLING club. This means anyone who knows bullying is happening is expected to tell staff and officials.</p>

<p>All officials, coaching and non-coaching staff, parents and children should know what the club policy is on bullying, and follow it when bullying is reported.</p>

<h3><font color="#00af50">What is bullying?</font></h3>

<p>Bullying is the use of aggression with the intention of hurting another person. Bullying results in pain and distress to the victim.</p>

<p>Bullying can take many forms some of which we’ve listed below:</p>

<ul>

    <li>Emotional: being unfriendly, excluding, tormenting - hiding kit or making threatening gestures</li> 
    <li>Physical: pushing, kicking, hitting, punching or any use of violence</li> 
    <li>Racist: racial taunts, graffiti and/or gestures</li> 
    <li>Verbal: name-calling, sarcasm, spreading rumours and teasing</li> 
    <li>Cyber: internet, text message or calls. Misuse of associated technology, eg camera and video</li> 
</ul>

<p>Some signs and symptoms – adults should investigate if a child:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Says they are being bullied</li>
    <li>Changes their usual routine</li>
    <li>Is unwilling to go to the club</li>
    <li>Becomes anxious, withdrawn or lacks confidence.</li>
    <li>Has possessions which are damaged or go missing</li>
    <li>Comes home with clothes torn or belongings damaged</li>
</ul>

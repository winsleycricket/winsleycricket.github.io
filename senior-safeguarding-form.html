<p>Winsley CC is committed to maintaining a respectful and secure environment for all members. As part of this commitment, we will ensure that photographs, video footage, or other media featuring players are taken and used responsibly.</p>
				<p>Winsley CC will take all reasonable steps to ensure that such images are used solely for their intended purpose namely, the promotion and celebration of cricketing activities. By participating in club events, matches, and training sessions, members acknowledge that their images may be captured and used in club communications, including but not limited to the club website, social media channels, newsletters, and promotional materials. If any member does not wish to have their image used, they may opt out by notifying the club in writing.</p>
				<p>Winsley CC follows the principles outlined in ’Safe Hands – Welfare of Young People in Cricket’, which can be accessed at <a href="https://www.ecb.co.uk/safehands" target="_blank">https://www.ecb.co.uk/safehands</a>. Please indicate your consent for the use of photographs and videos for the following purposes:</p>

      <p>Below are examples of your permissions: <font color="#ff0000">(I am not sure we can edit these)</font> </p>
<ul>
<li>I give my permission for photographs / videos to be captured for live streaming purposes.</li>
<li>I give my permission for photographs / videos to be captured for coaching and analysis purposes.</li>
<li>I give my permission for photographs / videos of me to be used on the club's website.</li>
<li>I give my permission for photographs / videos of me to be shared on the club's social media platforms.</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#ff0000">I am not sure about this paragraph, it doesn't seem consistent with ECB stuff about live-streaming/photography</font></p>
<p>Winsley CC recognises that some members may prefer not to be photographed or filmed during club activities. While we take all reasonable steps to manage photography at events, it remains the responsibility of individual members to inform the club if they do not wish to be photographed.</p>
			<p>If a member participates in an activity where photography or filming is taking place, and their image is inadvertently captured, Winsley CC cannot be held responsible for its inclusion. However, we will make every effort to respect members' preferences regarding the use of their images.</p>
			<p>If you wish to opt out of photography or filming, please notify the club in writing (safeguardingwinsleycc@gmail.com).</p><p>Please note that opting out may limit participation in activities where photography or live streaming is integral to the event (e.g. league-mandated streaming).</p>

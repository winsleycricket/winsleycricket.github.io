    <h1><font color="#00af50"><li>Purpose of this document</h1></li></font>

    <p>The purpose of this document is to define:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The methods used to select Winsley CC teams</li> 
    <li>Expectations on Captains around selection</li> 
    <li>Expectations on players around selection</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The selection committee consists of the captains (or vice-captain in the absence of the captain), the 
    Club Coach and the Club Captain who will chair the meeting.</p>


    <p>Selection will be carried out on a Monday evening. The previous weekend’s matches will be 
    discussed, as will the on-going individual & team performances which includes contributions in 
    matches and training. It is the responsibility of every player to ensure that their availability is known 
    to the selection committee. Availability must be informed directly by using WhatsApp /Text / ClubSport365 before 18:30 every Monday. If availability is not marked it will be assumed that the player is not 
    available for selection.</p>

    <h1><font color="#00af50"><li>General Selection Principles</h1></li></font>
    <ul>
    <li>1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> XI team will be picked on ability and performance to maximise the strength of 
    each team whilst also ensuring the correct balance (number of batsmen, spinners, fast bowlers 
    etc) of the team.</li>  
    <li>4<sup>th</sup> XI, Sunday and midweek cricket will be selected based on ensuring all members received 
    opportunities to play cricket.</li>  
    <li>Sunday and midweek cricket will also take into account wider contribution to the club when 
    selecting these sides. They will be treated independently of the Saturday 4<sup>th</sup> XI in that regard.</li>  
    <li>The 1<sup>st</sup> XI takes precedence over 2<sup>nd</sup> XI. The 2<sup>nd</sup> XI over 3<sup>rd</sup> XI. The 3<sup>rd</sup> XI over 4<sup>th</sup> XI.</li>  
    </ul>

    <h1><font color="#00af50"><li>Playing where selected</h1></li></font>
    <ul>
    <li>Players must play in the team they have been selected for.</li>

    <li>Any player who refuses to play for a specific team will no longer be eligible for selection. No 
    refunds of membership fees paid will be given.</li>

    <li>The selection committee is solely responsible for selection. It will operate under the principle 
    that the captain of the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>,3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> XI is responsible for the final decision of their own side 
    from the available players.</li>  
    <li>Any player changing their availability after the selection meeting must personally talk to their 
    team captain or the Club Captain ASAP.</li>  
    
    
    <li>Consistent offenders pulling out after making their availabilities known will be subject to the 
    possibility of not being selected when next available.</li>

    <li>Members unhappy at a selection matter should approach the relevant captain and Club Captain 
    to discuss the matter.</li>  

    </ul>

    <h1><font color="#00af50"><li>Player shortages</h1></li></font>
    
    <p>In the event of a team being short of players on the lead up or on match days itself, the higher XI has 
    the right to take a player from a lower XI providing the lower XI match hasn’t already started. This is 
    in accordance with WCCL rules.</p>
    
    
    <h1><font color="#00af50"><li>Dropping and promotion of players</h1></li></font>
    <p>Promotion and demotion of players from one team to the next must be based on performance or to 
    ensure the correct balance of the team (number of batsmen, spinners, fast bowlers etc). The only 
    exceptions to this would be disciplinary reasons or behavioural reasons laid out later in this 
    document.</p>
    
    
    <h1><font color="#00af50"><li>New players</h1></li></font> 
    <p>New players should not be considered for selection until a member of the selection committee has 
    seen them at nets or a non-league fixture.  The only exception would be in the event of a shortage of 
    players.</p> 

    <h1><font color="#00af50"><li>Selection of junior players</h1></li></font>  
    <p>A list of junior players available for adult selection will be drawn up at the start of the season by the 
    Youth Coordinator and updated throughout the season.</p>  
    <p>This information is to be shared with the Club Captain who in turn will share this with the rest of the 
    selection committee.</p>

    <p>A regular dialogue needs to take place between the Youth Coordinator, Club Coach and the Club 
    Captain with regards to these junior players.</p>

    <p>All parents must give written consent for their child to participate in senior cricket.</p>

    <p>Parents of junior players are asked not to approach captains before, during or after a game to 
    question selection or decisions around batting & bowling orders in senior cricket. A parent wishing to discuss any aspect of their child’s involvement in senior cricket, needs to do so with the Youth 
    Coordinator and the Club Captain.</p>

    <h1><font color="#00af50"><li>Behaviours and considerations attached to selection 
which are not disciplinary matters </h1></li></font>   

    <ul>
    <li>It is the player’s responsibility to establish whether a match has been called off due to 
    weather. Postponements will be posted on ClubSports365.</li>

    <li>Players selected will be notified by text of their game details and must confirm.</li>

    <li>Players persistently arriving late for meet times risk be dropped and this will be taken into 
    account at selection. For the avoidance of doubt persistently means two weeks in a row, two 
    weeks out of four, two weeks out of three or three weeks in total at any time.</li>

    <li>Players who are not breaching the Winsley CC code of conduct and disciplinary policy to the 
    point of action being required, but who fail to uphold our values and behavioural standards 
    risk be dropped and this will be taken into account at selection. A reminder of those values 
    and standards:</li>
    <ol>
    <li>Humility</li> 
    <li>Hard Work</li> 
    <li>Putting the team above self interest</li> 
    </ol>
    </ul>

    <p>Alongside 12 things that require zero talent:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Being on time</li>
        <li>Work Ethic</li> 
        <li>Effort</li> 
        <li>Body Language</li> 
        <li>Energy</li> 
        <li>Attitude</li> 
        <li>Passion</li> 
        <li>Being Coachable</li> 
        <li>Doing Extra</li> 
        <li>Being Prepared</li> 
        <li>Manners</li> 
        <li>Being Helpful</li> 
    </ul>

    <p>We encourage all members to demonstrate these values in any club activity.</p>

<p>We believe these principles, which are not grounded in success and results, will create an 
environment where good people share good experiences and values. That in turn will lead to the 
success and development which we believe everyone wants for Winsley CC.</p>

<p>This is why if someone is regularly not demonstrating these values and behaviours, they will risk 
impact on their selection. In the event this happens, the Captain and /or Club Captain will clearly 
highlight the reasons with factual examples to prior to the decision being made.</p>

<h1><font color="#00af50"><li>Accountability</h1></li></font> 
<p>In the event of any disputes or absences the Club Captain will take responsibility and accountability 
for uphold this policy and taking all relevant actions. </p>

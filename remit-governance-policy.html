        Together the Executive Committee must fulfil the five Core Governance Functions: 
        <ul>
        <li>Determine Mission and Strategy – setting the organisation’s direction and determining how it will 
        get there.  </li>
        <li>Accountability – being held to account for the actions of the organisation and holding those who 
        carry out the work to account.  </li>
        <li>Look after the committee – ensuring committee renewal (recruitment, induction and retirement), 
        effective decision making and information sharing processes, positive group dynamics, and 
        reflection, learning and development for the committee as necessary.  </li>
        <li>Safeguard assets - acting as custodian of the assets, tangible (money, property etc) and intangible 
        (organisation’s reputation and name), ensuring that assets are used appropriately and 
        constitutionally. Ensuring that there are sufficient assets for the organisation’s survival.  </li>
        <li>Linking the organisation to its stakeholders, such as members, the community, partners etc. In 
        addition</li> 
        </ul>

    <h2>How often it will meet</h2> 
    <p>A minimum of January (Season Prep), April (Pre-Season), June, August, October </p>

    <h2>How it will report </h2>
    <p>Through minutes taken by the Club secretary </p>


    <h2>How long it will be in existence </h2>
    <p>This is a standing committee. Elected at the AGM.</p>

    <h2>Executive Committee Member’s General Responsibilities</h2>
    All committee members should: 
    <ol>
    <li>Strive to attend all meetings, sending apologies to the chair for necessary absences.</li> 
    <li>Prepare for the meeting by reading the agenda, papers and emails before the meeting. </li>
    <li>Talk to the chair before the meeting if you need to clarify anything. </li>
    <li>Arrive on time. Stay to the end. </li>
    <li>Participate fully in the meeting; </li>
    <li>Listen to what others have to say and keep an open mind.</li> 
    <li>Contribute positively to the discussions. </li>
    <li>Try to be concise and avoid soliloquies/speeches.</li> 
    <li>Help others concentrate on the meeting. Discourage side conversations. </li>
    <li>Always have the best interests of the club in mind.</li> 
    <li>Draw attention to any potential conflicts of interest that may arise in the meeting.</li> 
    <li>Fulfil any responsibilities assigned to you at the meeting and be prepared to report back on your progress at the next meeting.</li> 
    </ol>

    Additionally, all committee members should:
    <ul>
    <li>Have a commitment to the organisation and its aims. ></li>
    <li>Have a willingness to devote the necessary time and effort.</li> 
    <li>Possess good judgement and independence of mind.</li>
    <li>Show a willingness to work collectively as part of a group.</li> 
    <li>Seek constructive debate and dialogue over confrontation</li> 
    </ul> 

    <p>If the elected officers offer no gender diversity, the Executive Committee will need to ensure at least 
    one, preferably two members of another gender are elected or co-opted to the Executive 
    Committee for that term. The executive committee shall be inquorate if those present at a meeting 
    are all of one gender. As stated in our Diversity commitment this is important to ensure balanced 
    and representative views of our membership.</p>

    <p>In the event an elected Committee Member can’t attend or fulfil their responsibilities at a meeting, 
    the Executive Committee would expect a deputy to be sent.  Alternatively, another officer or club 
    member can be co-opted for the purposes of the meeting.</p>

    <p>Should the Chair Person be unavailable, it is expected that the Committee will agree and vote (by 
    majority) for one of the Sub Committee Chairs to fulfil the Chair Person role until the elected Chair 
    Person can return to their duties at that meeting or generally.  Those taking on the Sub Committee 
    chair roles understand that this is part of those roles to ensure resilience.</p>

    <p>Should the Executive Committee recognise a fundamental flaw in our direction, remit policy or in not 
    achieving our intended goals, they will reserve the right to amend this policy and inform the club 
    membership of the changes and rationale.</p>
